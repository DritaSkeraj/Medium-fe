# Search

In this page you should be able to search articles by title or content and filter by category

Create a backend pagination for search results if they are many to display.
Use boootstrap for page buttons.

This page will read the parameters in the URL query.
For example, `search?topic=tech` will return every article with tech as a category.

Have fun!
